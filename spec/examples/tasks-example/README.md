Ki Tasks Example
================

The framework has a built in task system.

Tasks can be defined in the *tasks* directory and need to be valid ruby code.

You can see a list of tasks by running:

```
ki tasks
```

To run a specific task:

```
ki tasks task_name
```

In this project, we have a task called hello_world. You can run it with:

```
ki tasks hello_world
```
